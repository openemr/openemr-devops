### OpenEMR Setup

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services**, and then click **CloudFormation**.
2. Review the table and checkbox the row with **Stack Name** of **OpenEMR**.

4. Click the **Outputs** tab and click the link in the **URL** row.
5. Go through each step of the signup wizard.
   * Make sure you checkbox **I have already created the database** when asked.
   * The database password will be what you noted in the last chapter.
   * The MySQL host will be **mysql.openemr.local**.

### Post-Installation Security Update
