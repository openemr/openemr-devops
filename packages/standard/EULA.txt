EULA for OpenEMR Cloud services on AWS

1. Your use of OpenEMR software on AWS is governed by the terms of the AWS
   Customer Agreement (https://aws.amazon.com/agreement) or other agreement
   with AWS governing your use of AWS services.

2. OpenEMR software comes with no guarantees or warranties of any sort,
   either written or implied.

3. OpenEMR software is released pursuant to General GNU Public Licence
   (GNU GPL3) (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

4. OpenEMR software is provided by the author and contributors “AS IS” and any
   express or implied warranties including but not limited to the implied
   warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are
   disclaimed.  In no event shall the author or contributors be liable for any
   direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages
   (including but not limited to procurement of substitute goods or services;
   loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused
   and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or
   tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use
   of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.

5. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

6. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all
civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
