# OpenEMR Official Docker Image

This is the official OpenEMR docker image!

## Tags

Tags and their current aliases are shown below:

 - `5.0.0`: latest, stable

It is recommended to specify a version number in production, to ensure your build process pulls what you expect it to.

## How can I just spin up OpenEMR?

*You **need** to run an instance of mysql/mariadb as well and connect it to this container! You can then either use auto-setup with environment variables (see below) or you can manually set up, telling the server where to find the db.* The easiest way is to use `docker-compose`. The following `docker-compose.yml` file is a good example:
```yaml
# Use root/pass as user/password credentials
version: '3.1'
services:
  mysql:
    restart: always
    image: mysql
    command: ['mysqld','--character-set-server=utf8']
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
  openemr:
    restart: always
    build: ../../docker-images/openemr/
    ports:
    - 80:80
    volumes:
    - logvolume01:/var/log
    - sitevolume:/var/www/localhost/htdocs/openemr/sites/default
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: mysql
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASS: root
      MYSQL_USER: root
      MYSQL_PASS: root
      OE_USER: admin
      OE_PASS: pass
    links:
    - mysql
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
  sitevolume: {}
```

## Environment Variables

Setting `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_ROOT_PASS`, `MYSQL_PASS`, `MYSQL_HOST`, `OE_USER`, and `OE_PASS` will do the first-time setup process without manual intervention, setting the database connection using the `MYSQL_*` variables and adding an admin user to OpenEMR using `OE_USER` and `OE_PASS`.
