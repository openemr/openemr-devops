# OpenEMR Official Docker Image

The docker image is maintained at https://hub.docker.com/r/openemr/openemr/
(see there for more details)

## How can I just spin up OpenEMR?

*You **need** to run an instance of mysql/mariadb as well and connect it to this container! You can then either use auto-setup with environment variables (see below) or you can manually set up, telling the server where to find the db.* The easiest way is to use `docker-compose`. The following `docker-compose.yml` file is a good example:
```yaml
# Use admin/pass as user/password credentials to login to openemr (from OE_USER and OE_PASS below)
# MYSQL_HOST and MYSQL_ROOT_PASS are required for openemr
# FLEX_REPOSITORY and (FLEX_REPOSITORY_BRANCH or FLEX_REPOSITORY_TAG) are required for flex openemr
# MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASS, OE_USER, MYSQL_PASS are optional for openemr and
#   if not provided, then default to openemr, openemr, admin, and pass respectively.
