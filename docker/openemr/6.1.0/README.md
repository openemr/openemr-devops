# OpenEMR Official Docker Image

The docker image is maintained at https://hub.docker.com/r/openemr/openemr/
(see there for more details)

## Tags

See the https://hub.docker.com/r/openemr/openemr/ page for documentation of tags and their current aliases.

It is recommended to specify a version number in production, to ensure your build process pulls what you expect it to.

## How can I just spin up OpenEMR?

*You **need** to run an instance of mysql/mariadb as well and connect it to this container! You can then either use auto-setup with environment variables (see below) or you can manually set up, telling the server where to find the db.* The easiest way is to use `docker-compose`. The following `docker-compose.yml` file is a good example:
  - If you are using Raspberry Pi, then change the `mariadb:10.5` to `jsurf/rpi-mariadb`.
```yaml
# Use admin/pass as user/password credentials to login to openemr (from OE_USER and OE_PASS below)
# MYSQL_HOST and MYSQL_ROOT_PASS are required for openemr
# MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASS, OE_USER, MYSQL_PASS are optional for openemr and
#   if not provided, then default to openemr, openemr, admin, and pass respectively.
version: '3.1'
services:
  mysql:
    restart: always
    image: mariadb:10.5
    command: ['mysqld','--character-set-server=utf8mb4']
    volumes:
    - databasevolume:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
  openemr:
    restart: always
    image: openemr/openemr:6.1.0
    ports:
    - 80:80
    - 443:443
    volumes:
    - logvolume01:/var/log
    - sitevolume:/var/www/localhost/htdocs/openemr/sites
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: mysql
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASS: root
      MYSQL_USER: openemr
      MYSQL_PASS: openemr
      OE_USER: admin
      OE_PASS: pass
    depends_on:
    - mysql
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
  sitevolume: {}
  databasevolume: {}

## Environment Variables

See the https://hub.docker.com/r/openemr/openemr/ page for documentation of environment variables.

## Support on Raspberry Pi

Both 32 bit and 64 bit architectures are supported on Raspberry Pi. If you are using Raspberry Pi, then you need to change the `mariadb:10.5` to `jsurf/rpi-mariadb` in the above docker-compose.yml example.
