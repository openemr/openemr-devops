It is recommended to specify a version number in production, to ensure your build process pulls what you expect it to.

## How can I just spin up OpenEMR?

*You **need** to run an instance of mysql/mariadb as well and connect it to this container! You can then either use auto-setup with environment variables (see below) or you can manually set up, telling the server where to find the db.* The easiest way is to use `docker-compose`. The following `docker-compose.yml` file is a good example:
```yaml
# Use admin/pass as user/password credentials
version: '3.1'
services:
  mysql:
    restart: always
    image: mysql
    command: ['mysqld','--character-set-server=utf8']
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
  openemr:
    restart: always
    image: openemr/openemr
    ports:
    - 80:80
    - 443:443
    volumes:
    - logvolume01:/var/log
    - sitevolume:/var/www/localhost/htdocs/openemr/sites/default
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: mysql
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASS: root
      MYSQL_USER: root
      MYSQL_PASS: root
      OE_USER: admin
      OE_PASS: pass
    links:
    - mysql
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
  sitevolume: {}
```

## Environment Variables

Required environment settings for auto installation are `MYSQL_HOST` and `MYSQL_ROOT_PASS` (Note that can force `MYSQL_ROOT_PASS` to be empty by passing as 'BLANK' variable).

Optional settings for the auto installation include database parameters `MYSQL_ROOT_USER`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASS`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, and openemr parameters `OE_USER`, `OE_PASS`.

Can override auto installation and force manual installation by setting `MANUAL_SETUP` environment setting to 'yes'.

Can use both port 80 and 443. Port 80 is standard http. Port 443 is https/ssl and uses a self-signed certificate by default; if assign the `DOMAIN` and `EMAIL`(optional) environment settings, then it will set up and maintain certificates via letsencrypt.
