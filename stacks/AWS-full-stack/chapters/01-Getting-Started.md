# ðŸš´ Getting Started

### Create an AWS Account

1. Navigate to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), and then click **Create an AWS Account**. If you already have an account, feel free to continue to the next section.
2. Follow along with the signup wizard.

### Select a Region

This guide uses services that are _only_ available in certain AWS regions. As of this writing, you will need to make sure you're in one the of four Amazon regions described below.

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services**, and then click **EC2**.
2. In the region dropdown in the top right corner, select either **N. Virginia** (least expensive), **Oregon**, **Ireland**, or **Sydney**. Be sure to remain in this region for the remainder of this guide.

### Generate an SSH Keypair

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services** and then click **EC2**.
2. In the left pane, under **Network & Security**, click **Key Pairs**.
3. Click **Create Key Pair**.
4. When the **"Create Key Pair"** dialog appears, enter your username for the **Key pair name** field and click **Create**.
5. When the **Save As** dialog appears, save the .pem keyfile to a safe place. This file will be referred to in later chapters. _IMPORTANT: This will only be available once for download and is needed for future systems access._

### Launch your Cloud

1. Click the region link below that corresponds to the region you created your keypair in:
